## Introduction

A collection of computer vision projects implemented in Python, showcasing face detection, finger detection, pose estimation and smile detection using popular libraries such as Mediapipe, OpenCV, PyAutoGUI, and NumPy.

## Projects

### Project 1: Face Detection
- **Description:** Detects faces in images or real-time video streams using the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries.
- **Code:** [Link to Face Detection Project](https://github.com/AhnafTahmid1776/computer-Vision/tree/main/Face%20Recognition)


### Project 2: Finger Detection
- **Description:** Detects fingers and hand gestures using the Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries.
- **Code:** [Link to Finger Detection Project](https://github.com/AhnafTahmid1776/computer-Vision/tree/main/Finger%20Detection)


### Project 3: Pose Estimation
